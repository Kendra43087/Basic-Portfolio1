      <p>Hi, my name is Kendra Im 31 years old and originally from Roanoke, VA. I moved to Richmond, Va to attend college to persue a degree in Marketing. After trying a couple more times to attend college I realized it wasn't for me. I started working in call centers and Mortgage Offices I realized this wasn't enough for me. Then I continued my education on line I completed my Comp A+, Networking, and Securties certifications also I have my health insurance license. Its time for me to make a career change to something that's profitable and enjoyable.</p>
